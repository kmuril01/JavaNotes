/* Figure 4-4
 * shows a typical class that would be used to declare
 * an Employee class containing one private data field 
 * and two public methods, all of which are nonstatic. 
 * This class becomes the model for a new data type 
 * named Employee; when Employee objects eventually 
 * are created, each will have its own empNum field, 
 * and each will have access to two methodsâ€”one that 
 * provides a value for its empNum field and another 
 * that retrieves the value stored there.
 *  
 *    public class Employee
 *      {
 *        private int empNum;
 *        public int getEmpNum()
 *          {
 *              return empNum;
 *          }
 *        public void setEmpNum(int emp)
 *          {

 *          }
 *      }
 * 
 * Figure 4-5
 * Most classes that you create have multiple data 
 * fields and methods. For example, in addition to 
 * requiring an employee number, an Employee needs 
 * a last name, a first name, and a salary, as well 
 * as methods to set and get those fields. Figure 4-5 
 * shows one way you could arrange the data fields 
 * for the Employee class.
