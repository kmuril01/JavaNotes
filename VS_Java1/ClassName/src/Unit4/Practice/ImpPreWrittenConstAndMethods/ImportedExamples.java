/*
 * You already have used several of these prewritten classes;
 * for example, you have used the System and JOptionPane classes 
 * to produce output. Each of these classes is stored in a package, 
 * or a library of classes, which is simply a folder that provides a 
 * convenient grouping for classes. Java has two categories of packages:
 * 
 * The java.lang package is implicitly imported into every program you write. 
 * The classes it contains are fundamental classes that provide the basis of 
 * the Java programming language. The System class, which you have used to 
 * access print() and println(), is an automatically imported class in the 
 * java.lang package. You will learn about many other fundamental classes later. 
 * Some references list a few other Java classes as also being “fundamental,” 
 * but the java.lang package is the only automatically imported, named package.
 * 
 * All other Java packages are available only if you explicitly name them within 
 * your program. These packages contain the optional classes. For example, when 
 * you use JOptionPane, you must import the javax.swing package into your program, 
 * and when you use the LocalDate class, you must import the java.time package, 
 * as you learn later in this chapte
